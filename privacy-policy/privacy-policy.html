				<h2>Website Visitors</h2>
				<p>Like most internet businesses, we collect non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request.&nbsp; Our purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how our visitors use our websites, services and applications.&nbsp; From time to time, we may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of our services.</p>
				<p>The nature of our websites, services and applications means that we may also collect potentially personally-identifying information at times, such as Internet Protocol (IP) addresses for logged in users.&nbsp; We only disclose such information under the same circumstances that we use and disclose personally-identifying information as described below, except that such data may be made visible and disclosed to the administrators of the websites, services or applications being used.</p>

				<h2>Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
				<p>Certain users of our websites, services or applications choose to interact with us in ways that require us to gather personally-identifying information.&nbsp; The amount and type of information that we gather depends on the nature of the interaction.&nbsp; For example, we may ask visitors who sign up for a service to provide a username and email address, or to supply the personal and financial information required to process a payment transaction.&nbsp; In such cases, we aim to collect only as much information as is necessary or appropriate to fulfill the immediate purpose.&nbsp; We do not disclose personally-identifying information other than as described below.&nbsp; Users can always refuse to supply personally-identifying information, with the caveat that it may prevent them from engaging in certain activities.</p>

				<h2>Protection of Certain Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
