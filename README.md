A repository of the miscellaneous legal documents which a startup tech company might require - all released under a Creative Commons license :)



Some of these documents are based upon those created by <a href="http://automattic.com/about/">Automattic, Inc.</a> for their excellent WordPress service, and which they make available under a <strong>Creative Commons</strong> license - thanks guys.&nbsp; We have adapted and generalised their work to make it applicable to any internet service and have in turn published it under a Creative Commons license so that you also are free to use it for your own purposes.
